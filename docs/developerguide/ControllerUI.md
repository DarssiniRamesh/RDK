# 9. Controller UI:

Controller UI is a web UI that can be launched from a host machine's (machine under the same network where RPi resides) browser. This UI can be loaded with the RPi box's IP address with Thunder's port number configured (here). RDKServices uses **9998** as port.

    URL: http://<Rpi's IP address>:9998
